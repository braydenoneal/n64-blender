Todo
=======

- [x] uv shift
- [x] color overlay
- [x] solid color objects
- [x] figure out ambient light and directional light = [image x ambient + image x directional]
- [x] figure out directional light strength calculation (normals)
- [x] ensure that lighting is correct (rgb color accuracy and light strength stuff)
- [x] figure out why texture is unstable = [blend mode alpha blend makes it unstable]
- [x] ambient color
- [x] directional light
- [x] translucency
- [;] global variables [panel control]
- [ ] global overrides
- [ ] set defaults for globals
- [ ] reset sidebar options to default when creating new material
- [ ] world space light direction toggle
- [ ] post-processing: horizontal blur and large antialiasing
- [ ] skybox
- [ ] clean up nodes and ui (maybe convert back to curved routes)
- [ ] vertex alpha (for texture transitions too)
- [ ] multiple textures
- [ ] texture scroll
- [ ] texture animation
- [ ] color masked textures? (think colored bundles)

Later
-----

- particles
- collision
- object placement
- fix fog edge artifacts
- object pointers for shader data? (directional light object, ambient light object, fog object, etc.)
- smooth shading toggle?
- consider the fact that most color features can not make the original brighter
- automatic vertex color tool based on configuration (ambient occlusion, light source, shadows)
